When learning a new concept, it's easy to get stuck in the planning phase and convince ourselves that watching a YouTube series or reading various articles and books will be enough to get us to where we want to be. While planning ahead and researching a topic is important, it's not as effective as actually practicing and doing the work.

Instead of spending hours researching a topic, allocate just enough time of your time to learn the basics. From there, focus on the doing part. In this series, we'll choose a topic (mainly programming related) and apply the "Learn by Doing" approach to it. These posts will usually include an introductory post the will take you through the basics followed by a series of posts focused on **"doing"** the actual work.

By following along with this series, you'll have the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of various topics, apply what you've learned in a practical setting, and achieve your goals. So let's get started and learn by doing!

> The first topic is going to be Dynamic Programming so stay tuned!
